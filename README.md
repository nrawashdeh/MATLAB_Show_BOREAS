"A MATLAB Script for Visualizing and Processing BOREAS Dataset Road Driving Sensor Data: LiDAR, Radar, and Camera"

This MATLAB code reads LiDAR, RADAR and Camera frames from the BOREAS road driving dataset and displays them concurrently in time. You can use this code to read frames and use MATLAB functions to analyze or process them.
